Built a complete file-to-text extraction frontend with drag-and-drop
upload supporting PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, TXT, HTML, Markdown, RTF,
and ODT formats. Implemented
real-time status polling that tracks processing progress and displays
extraction methods. Added comprehensive error/success feedback with
warning system for empty pages including diagnostic suggestions. UI
displays extracted text per page with metadata (character counts,
extraction method, sheet names for Excel) in a clean responsive
interface. Enhanced backend with automatic document chunking and
multilingual vector embeddings using Sentence-Transformers that
process in background after text extraction. Implemented persistent
FAISS vector storage containing chunks, embeddings, and search
indices ready for future retrieval features with full Arabic
language support.
